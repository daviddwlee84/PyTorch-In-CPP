# Basic LibTorch Example: Print Tensor (See if environment setup correctly)

## Getting Started

Finish the prerequisites (get `libtorch` installed or use `torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path`), just modify in `build.sh` and then run it.
Go to `build/` and will see `example-app` executable to run

(Assume we download `libtorch` at the root of this repository (same level as `.git`), if you tend to put in other places, you sould modify the path in `build.sh`)
